Accounting for Cancer Patients with Severe Outcomes: An Anomaly Detection Perspective
This repository hosts the code used in the research paper "Accounting for Cancer Patients with Severe Outcomes: An Anomaly Detection Perspective," accepted at the IEEE 2024 Big Data PhD Forum. The study explores the application of 10 unsupervised anomaly detection approaches from ADBench to Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) datasets, aiming to identify severe outcomes in cancer patients.

Installation
To set up the environment to run the code, execute:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To replicate the analysis, run:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_pros.py
Data
The datasets analyzed in this study consist of PROs related to cancer patient outcomes. Due to privacy and confidentiality, the data is not publicly shared in this repository.

Methods
The paper implements ten different unsupervised anomaly detection models from the ADBench toolkit. These models have been applied to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying high-risk patient outcomes based on PROs.
